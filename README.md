# Artoo Adaptor For Arduino

This repository contains the Artoo (http://artoo.io/) adaptor and drivers for Arduino and Arduino-compatible microcontrollers (http://arduino.cc/) using the Firmata protocol (http://firmata.org).

Artoo is a open source micro-framework for robotics using Ruby.

For more information abut Artoo, check out our repo at https://github.com/hybridgroup/artoo

This gem makes extensive use of the hybridgroup fork of the firmata gem (https://github.com/hybridgroup/firmata) thanks to [@hardbap](https://github.com/hardbap) with code borrrowed from the arduino_firmata gem (https://github.com/shokai/arduino_firmata) thanks to [@shokai](https://github.com/shokai)

## Installing

```
gem install artoo-arduino
```

## Using

```ruby
require 'artoo'

connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
device :board, :driver => :device_info
device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

work do
  puts "Firmware name #{board.firmware_name}"
  puts "Firmata version #{board.version}"
  every 1.second do
    led.toggle
  end
end
```

## Devices supported

The following hardware devices have driver support via the artoo-gpio gem:
- Button
- LED
- Maxbotix ultrasonic range finder
- Analog sensor
- Motor (DC)
- Servo

The following hardware devices have driver support via the artoo-i2c gem:

- Wiiclassic controller

## Connecting to Arduino

### OSX

The main steps are:
- Install the artoo-arduino gem
- Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
- Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
- Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port. A dialog box will appear telling you that a new network interface has been detected. Click "Network Preferences...", and when it opens, simply click "Apply".

Install the artoo-arduino gem:

```
$ gem install artoo-arduino
```

Once plugged in, use the `artoo connect scan -t serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

```
$ artoo connect scan -t serial
```

Use the `artoo firmata install` command to install avrdude,
this will allow us to upload firmata to the arduino:

```
$ artoo firmata install
```

Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to
the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran `artoo
connect scan -t serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `/dev/ttyACM0`:

```
$ artoo firmata upload /dev/ttyACM0
```

Now you are ready to connect to the Arduino using a socket, in this example the socket to serial is set on port 4567 (which is also the default value):

```
artoo connect serial ttyACM0 4567
```

### Ubuntu

The main steps are:
- Install the artoo-arduino gem
- Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
- Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
- Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.

Install the artoo-arduino gem:

```
$ gem install artoo-arduino
```

Once plugged in, use the `artoo connect scan -t serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

```
$ artoo connect scan -t serial
```

Use the `artoo firmata install` command to install avrdude,

```
$ artoo firmata install

```
$ artoo firmata upload /dev/ttyACM0
```

Now you are ready to connect to the Arduino using a socket, in this example the socket to serial is set on port 4567 (which is also the default value):

```
artoo connect serial ttyACM0 4567
```
